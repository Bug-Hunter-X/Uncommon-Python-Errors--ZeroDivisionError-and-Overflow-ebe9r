This repository demonstrates a couple of less frequently encountered errors in Python. The primary focus is on a ZeroDivisionError, which occurs when a division by zero is attempted, causing the program to crash.  In addition, it also highlights a potential overflow error that might not immediately be apparent, arising from extremely small divisors leading to exceptionally large results that surpass the system's floating-point representation capabilities. The solution showcases how to effectively handle these conditions to make the code robust.
